			<h3>About MoodzART</h3>
			<p>A recording is a story that never changes.</p>
			<p>From the moment it is made, the words, melody, arrangement and performance together become a 3-minute narrative that is frozen in time.</p>
			<p>Glen Campbell hasn't made it to Phoenix yet. <br/>
				A Milkshake will always bring the boys to the yard.<br />
				Frank Sinatra can only ever do it his Way. <br />
				..and R.E.S.P.E.C.T can only ever spell respect.</p>
			<p>But each recording also tells countless other stories. They are the stories of people, places, technologies, emotions, and a new one is created each time someone presses play. </p>
			<p>These are the stories created by song.</p>


			<p>This prototype interface was developed in 24 hours during the Popathon event at Warwick University between 27th and 28th February, 2015. </p>
			<p>Responding to a brief based on Bret Victor's idea of 'Explorable Explanations', the team took the raw data generated by The Harkive Project, an online, crowd-sourced method of gathering stories from music fans about the detail of their listening, to create a protoype interface based on the following premise: 'I, as a music fan, want to explore music in a fuzzy, emotional way, because I am HUMAN'. </p>	
			<p>A motivation for this approach was to explore and test the idea that music in the digital age has lost something important: the human, emotional element. Not only are musical formats themselves intangible, but the very act of consumption is now subject to rigorous measurement and analysis, a process which is, in turn, informing the style and manner in which music is created and distributed. This interface is a small step towards reviving the basic, emotional, human elements in the musical experience. We hope you like it. </p>
			<p>SOMETHING ABOUT IT BEING OPEN SOURCE, SO PLEASE PLAY WITH IT</p>
			<p>The team behind the project were: Daniel Gona, Zheng Shi, and Craig Hamilton. Technical assistance, support and mentoring was provided by Philo van Kemenade, Gilles Pradeau, Basile Simon and Javier Abanses.</p>

	
			    <h3>About The Harkive Project</h3>
		    <p>The Harkive Project is an online, crowd-sourced method of gathering stories from people about the detail of their music listening. Rather than gathering quantitative data about the songs people listen to, the project is specifically interested in the technologies, formats and services people use, the places and locations they find themselves in when they listen, and the way music makes them feel.</p>
		    <p>Harkive asks 'How, Where and Why' people are listening on a single day each year. The project has so far run on two occasions, in July 2013 and July 2014. In that time over 5,000 individual entries have been added to the database, and it is this data that forms the basis of the interface you are currently viewing. </p>	
		    <p>For more information about The Harkive Project, please visit the <a href="http://www.harkive.org">website</a>, or email <a href=mailto:info@harkive.org>info@harkive.org</a>. You can also follow Harkive on <a href="http://www.twitter.com/harkive">Twitter</a> and <a href="http://www.facebook.com/harkive">Facebook</a>. </p>
		    <p>The project will return for a 3rd time in July 2015, so please do consider getting involved. </p>
